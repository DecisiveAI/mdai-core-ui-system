# MyDecisive Core UI System

This repository and package are where our UI components live! Our UI core is primarily based on the @material/web web components library.

# Getting Started

## Installation

```sh
npm i --save @mydecisive/ui
```

## Usage

Import the JS package and code into your app with:

```ts
// importing this file will import all web components. You do not need to import individual components where they are used in your application.
import "mydecisive-core-ui-system";

// import styles. Vite-based projects should be able to accept these imports and work like ðŸª„ magic ðŸª„. Webpack projects may need a CSS loader.
import "mydecisive-core-ui-system/mdai-base.css";
// import a color theme
import "mydecisive-core-ui-system/mdai-theme-console.css";
// or
import "mydecisive-core-ui-system/mdai-theme-website.css";
```
